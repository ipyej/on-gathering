        What would you like to gather?
        
        Determine the topic for your crowd-sourced collection.
        Determine your method for aggregating content.
        How many entries would you like?
        Is it for an organization?
        Is it media-specific? (e.g. written quotes, hand-drawn portraits, PDFs, etc)
        Is there a time period?
        Does it fill a void?
